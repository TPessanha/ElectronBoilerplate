# ElectronBoilerplate (Still in development)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TPessanha/ElectronBoilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TPessanha/ElectronBoilerplate)

A boilerplate for electron main features include (React, Jest, Webpack, hot-reloading, typescript, and more full list will be provided at a later date).

While you can use this as is, I don't recomend it until its actually finished.

This project used as base the [electron-react-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/iRath96/electron-react-typescript-boilerplate), and then I changed some things to fit my personal tastes.
