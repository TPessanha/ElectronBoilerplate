# ElectronBoilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TPessanha/ElectronBoilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TPessanha/ElectronBoilerplate) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yutvybpi7572neuc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TPessanha/electronboilerplate)

A boilerplate for rapid application development using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) or Web built around [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).


This project uses as base the [electron-react-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/iRath96/electron-react-typescript-boilerplate) and takes inspiration from other projects like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and then I changed some things to fit my personal tastes.
